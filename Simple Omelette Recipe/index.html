            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <span>Beat the eggs</span>: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are<br/>well mixed. 
                    You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
                </li>
                <li><span>Heat the pan</span>: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>
                <li>
                    <span>Cook the omelette</span>: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the<br/>pan to ensure 
                    the eggs evenly coat the surface.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Add fillings (optional)</span>: When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly<br/>runny in the 
                    middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Fold and serve</span>: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it<br/>over the 
                    fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
                </li>
                <li><span>Enjoy</span>: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
